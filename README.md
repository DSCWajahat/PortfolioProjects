# Fahion Classifier
In this project, I classified different fashion items and also I applied EDA on dataset using PCA and t-SNE methods. By using modified LeNet model,I got almost 98% accuracy on classifying items.
# Fahion Recommender
I used modified LeNet to extract features and used them to get similiar fashion products using sklearn nearest neighbours module.
# Four Shapes Classification
In this project, I used modified LeNet CNN to classify different types of shapes and got 99% accuracy.
# Netflix Analysis
This project aims to build a movie recommendation mechanism within Netflix. The dataset I used here come directly from Netflix which can be downloaded rom kaggle.
# Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis
The objective of this project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset
# UFO Sightings Analysis
I investigated UFO data over the last century to formulate some questions, and gain insight regarding what the answers may be. This is also be a useful notebook on seeing how one may get their brain juices flowing when faced with an unknown dataset.
# Classification Comparisons
The goal of this project was to load a dummy dataset and apply different classification techniques using sklearn and perform EDA and graphs comparisons between the performance of each classification algorithm
